The global film industry is a **$100 billion worth industry**. There is a vast potential to earn money, and the producers are willing to sacrifice considerable costs to become a movie success. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the most expensive film, cost $379 million. With such an amount at your disposal, you may wonder how you should spend the money. Should you use them to get one of the biggest movie stars in your cast? For many, this may be tempting. One of the most famous actors, Tom Cruise, was rewarded $100,000,000 for his performance in Top Gun: Maverick. But was it worth it? Or could the money be better spent? 


### The Data Used:
We will be using the CMU Movie Summary Corpus which contains data on the revenue of **8 401 movies**. We will analyze this data to create a recipe for a successful movie.



### Goal:

In our initial analysis, we define the success of a movie in terms of box office revenue. To create a recipe for the production of a successful film, we have limited ourselves to five main research questions:

* Does the movie release date have a significant impact on the success of a film, and if so, what is the optimal release date concerning the time of the year? Subsequently, the question arises whether this result differs for different genres.
* How do the gender ratio and the fraction of ethnicities in the cast affect the success of a movie?
* Do certain actors have a significant positive or negative impact on the success of a movie?
* Is the length of a movie related to its success, and if so, in what way?
* Is the use of negatively connoted words, positively connoted words, and words related to violence in the movie plot associated with the success of the movie?

### Network Analysis of Actors
We have made a flavor network graph, with nodes representing actors and edges representing the movies that they have appeared in together. The size of the nodes reflects the average revenue of the movies that the actor has appeared in, while the width of the edges indicates the number of times that the actors have appeared in a movie together. There are 61 actors and 256 connections.

We want to get greater insight into our flavor graph, by using network analysis techniques to identify clusters of actors who have appeared in many movies together and to measure the centrality of each actor in the network. We start by using a network community detection algorithm to identify groups of actors who tend to appear in movies together and explore how these communities contribute to movie success. In specific, we use the Louvain method to get a "best" partition of communities.

We have partitioned the network of actors into six communities based on their connections through movies, which suggests that there are distinct subgroups of actors who tend to work together more frequently.
We see that the average revenue generated by actors within each community varies, and that there are a few actors who stand out as particularly successful in terms of average revenue.
We have not explored the potential reasons for these patterns, but some possibilities include the genre or type of film associated with each community, the fame or recognition of the actors within the industry, or the social connections between the actors. However, for our purpose, we want to explore how the revenue is affected by including actors from different communities vs including actors from the same community.

To explore the relationship between an actor's connection to other actors and the average revenue, we want to look at the centrality of each actor. We create a scatterplot where the x-axis represents the degree centrality and the y-axis represents the average revenue of the movies that the actor has appeared in

We plot our initial flavor graph once again, but now make a distinction on the connections within communities and those that are between communities. In this flavor plot, the edges that are crossing two different communities are marked in yellow. As expected, these edges are thinner which makes sense since the partition of communities is based on actors that frequently play in the same movies. However, what we are interested in is if there is a difference on the revenue made by sticking to one community when creating a movie cast, or if it is better to make a movie cast with actors from multiple communities.

We would like to split the movies into movies that have a cast with the majority of actors within a community, and movies that have a cast that are more evenly spread among the communities. We observe that the average revenue for the majority_community_movies is higher than the average revenue for the spread_community_movies. This suggests that it is better to stick to one community when creating a movie cast. However, we also observe that the movies that have a cast that is more evenly spread among the communities have a larger spread in revenue. This suggests that it might be beneficial to mix up the cast, but it also suggests that there is a risk of the movie not being as successful.

## Runtime

Blockbuster movies ($400 million+) have, on average, 10.1% longer runtime than non-blockbuster movies.
Movies with short runtime (<80min) have 54.8% less revenue than non-short movies.
